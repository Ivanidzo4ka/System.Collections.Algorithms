# System.Collections.Algorithms
Purpose of this repository is to bring set of collections into .Net world so people don't have to reinvent them all the time.

Implemented:
- Priority queue
- Treap
- Sqrt tree
- Van Emde Boas tree.
- Fenwick tree.

Would be nice to have:
- Trie
- Segment tree
- Randomize heap
and maybe more
